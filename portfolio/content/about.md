# Hello There!

My name is Ben Schreiber. I'm a student at Washington State University studying Computer Science. I grew up in Cheney, Washington. During my senior year of highschool (2021-2022), I was a student athlete competing at both the club level and highschool level as team captain, and also competed in Future Business Leaders of America in Computer Science related events such as Web Design or Computer Programming (software engineering), placing nationally. 

I currently work as a Software Developer intern at Intellitect, a Software Development consulting company in Spokane, Washington. I currently work with Flutter and Dart for iOS, Android and Mac applications, with an Azure hosted ASP NET based backend.
