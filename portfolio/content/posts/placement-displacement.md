For this piece, the prompt was to use Place and Displacement to address issues cultural conflicts where one group is displacing another. I wanted to take an economic point of view on this, and decided to look at the economic class seperation in the United States.

My piece captures the upper 1% displacing everyone below them. I show this by showing the wealth distribution curve, which is incredibly high on the 1%. From the top of the curve, the wealthy are throwing down a fraction of what they make to the other economic classes. I chose to have a dollar lit aflame to represent their disregard for money that is essential to the livelyhood of the lower classes.

The elements of art that I incorporated into the piece is line, shape, and space. I decided to use lines to depict a graph for the curve, and shape to represent the inviduals. Instead of having a background, I decided to instead have empty space to give emphasis to the lines that are on the page, and not make the art piece have too much going on.

For the technical requirement, I used the shape tools and RGB color space to create small objects entirely from scratch. These were very difficult to make (as someone who isn't great at drawing), and took a lot of learning illustrator to do. The flame on the dollar bill had an especially complicated process to make, involving grouping circles in specific patterns and then deleting overlapping portions.

Place and Displacement is shown through the economic standpoint I took on the piece, and is well represented by my usage of the elements of art, and the illustrator concepts that I learned for this assignment.
